Setup `gaincal` to write a calibration table (you have to define `caltable`) with the proper `‘smodel’`, a 5 min interval is sufficient at 18 cm to counter the ionospheric fluctuations over the telescopes, and set one of the center antennas as the reference. \n",

However, at a sufficiently low resolution, every source is a point source. Enter `multiscale` clean. When `deconvolver='multiscale'`, `tclean` concurrently deconvolves images at various amounts of smoothing. A clean component found at a scale of 16 pixels, is rendered on the model image as a Gaussian blob of width 16. You can specify the scales to find components for using the `scales` parameter. Usually, `scales` of powers of two (with 0 representing an actual point), work well: `scales=[0,1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128]`.\n",

    "When drawing your clean masks in the previous section, you have probably looked at your residual image, and drawn lines around the brightest patches. This is of course a perfect job for a computer. When you set `usemask='auto-multithresh'`, `tclean` will automatically determine a clean mask per deconvolver scale!\n",
