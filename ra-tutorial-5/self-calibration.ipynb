    "\n",
    "In the previous session you learned the basic concepts of synthesis imaging. This session will build on that with selfcalibration. The dataset for this session was taken with the VLBA, which allows us to image the extragalactic source BL Lacertae on size scales of milli- arcseconds. The data has been calibrated and fringe-fitted to correct for the additional delays introduced by the fact that your antennas are widely distributed, and on independent clocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data are in `ra2017tut2.tar`.  Untar with the command `tar xvf\n",

    "## Data Inspection\n",
    "\n",
    "First, familiarize yourself with the data. Don’t take too long here, more importantly you want to get to imaging. There are three files:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - bllac.2cm.MS: 15 GHz dataset\n",
    "  - bllac.4cm.cal.MS: 7.5 GHz dataset, already self-calibrated\n",
    "  - bllac.4cm.mod.MS: 7.5 GHz dataset, but with an error introduced.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Start with the 7.5 GHz, already self-calibrated, dataset. You can use `listobs` to gather general information on the\n",
    "observation. Use `plotms` to look at amplitude vs. time, and amplitude vs. uv-distance (UVdist).\n",

    "go find it.) Robust weighting comes from the late Dan Briggs.* Use `viewer` to inspect not only the images, but the psf and the residuals. Do you see differences in them for different weightings?"

    "Now image the `bllac.4cm.mod.MS` dataset and look at the resultant image. What sort of error do you think is\n",

    "This is stored in the model column of your measurement\n",
    "set when `tclean` is run with `savemodel='modelcolumn'`, or `savemodel='virtual'`, and is overwritten every time you run `tclean` with one of those options. The task `gaincal` is used to calibrate the data against the model column or virtual model. Then you can use `plotcal` to\n",
    "look at the solutions, and `applycal` to apply them. This process is iterated until the self-calibration converges, i.e., the solutions don't change anymore. The solutions are always applied\n",

    "  1. Use clean to create a source model with current data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Each time you loop from steps 1 to 3 you have done one iteration\n",
    "of self-calibration. In practice one usually performs at\n",
    "least five rounds of self-cal. Each iteration slowly (hope-\n",
    "fully) converges to a global solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each step requires understanding. For instance, in step 1 when creating a model with `tclean`, it doesn’t make sense to clean too deeply, because we are not actually sure about the source distribution (since the data is not fully calibrated yet). `gaincal` will try to calibrate the data to the model you give so you don’t want to start off too confident about the model by cleaning too deep.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also in step 2 there are different types of calibration one can perform. What are these?"

    "\n",
